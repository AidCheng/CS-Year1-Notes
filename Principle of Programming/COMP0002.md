## Compiler - `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection)

- Four step compilation
    1. **Preprocessing**: removing comments, expanding macros and expanding included files
    2. **Compiling**: takes out put of the first step and generates assembly lang, specific to the target processor (an optimisation happens after compiling)
    3. **Assembly**: Convert the assembly code into pure **binary code or machine code**
    4. **Linking**: Merges all the object code from multiple modules into a single one

## Imperative Programming

### Imperative (definition)

- A sequence of commands that **use mutable (changable) memory** to store information
- Each computation transform the initial state of the memory to the final state

### Basic Control Constructs

- Sequence
  - One command after another
- Selection
  - `if - then - else`
- Iteration
  - Repeat the same sequence certain number of times

### Imperative Language Features

The basic ILFs including if statement, while loops and for loops etc.

### Function

- Definition
  - A named sequence of commands
    - Basic unit of *abstraction*
    - Gives **structure** to program
    - Reduce duplication (*one of the way*)
  - Invoked by a *function call*

### Abstraction

- A **representation or model**
- That includes the important, essental or distinguishing aspects of something
- While **ignoring** less important, immaterial or diversionary details
- **Removing distinctions to emphasise commonality**

### Operations and Expressions

- **Operator**
  - applies an operation to values

- We can combine vars, operators and iterals to write *expressions*
- A statement consists of one ofr more expressions
  - `age = 20;` is a complete statement consisting of an ***assignment expression***
  - an variable is changed by **an assignment expression**

### Precedence

- Basic mathematical precedence (* and / have higher precedence than + or -)

### Comparison

- **Relational Operators**
  - <,>,<=,>=,!=
  - = (assign operation) has lower precendence than relational operators

- **Boolean** **Type**
  - *C language* does not define a Boolean type
  - Can be replaced using `stdbool.h` *library*
    - Implemented using language features, *is not an original part of the language*

- **Floating point comparison**

    ```c
        #include<math.h>
        double value1, value2;
        double tolerance = 1e-6;
        // fabs(): floating point absolute value
        if(fabs(value1-value2) < tolerance){
            // Consider equal
        } else {
            // not equal
        }
    ```

### `++` and `--`

- increment or decrement an int variable
- position of the symbol:
  - placed before var: calculate `++` before any other operation related to var
  - placed after var: vice versa
  - example:
    - `while(++x < 10)`: x is incremented first then compare

### Iteration statement

- **for loop:** usually the preferred solution in *C*
- while loop
- do loop
  - operated at least once, and checked by while statement

## Arrays

myArray[0]

- [ ]: *index operator*

### Why Count From 0?

- An array index is the ***offset*** from the first memory location of this array
  - The size of each offset depends on the size of the type of element stored
  - e.g for `int (4 bytes)`, offset = index * 4 bytes

### Initialisation

- Local array: unintialised, elements already on the memory occupies
- File Scope Array (decleared outside any code block "{}"): automatically initialised to 0 when declared

### Bounds Check

```c
// initialises
int a[6] = 0; 
// outside bound, but compiles without error and print the value on that address
printf("%d", a[6]); 
//!!! this Overwrites the memory
a[6] = 1; 
```

### Array Length

- A *C Array* does not store its length!
- Have to track the length separately `int lengthA = 6;`

### type `size_t`

- Feature
  - **unsigned** integer type represent value sizes in *bytes*
  - strictly should use this type for any size or array length
  - Defined in `stddef.h`
  - The size of a value depend on the processor, compiler and OS
- **`sizeof`** operator
  - returns the size of a var in *bytes*

    ```c
    size_t arraySize = 1000;
    int myArray[arraySize];

    size_t intSize = sizeof(int); // 4B
    size_t doubleSize = sizeof(double); // 8B
    ```

### Arrays and Functions

- Arrays can be passed as a parameter (pointer)
- But is not **copied**

### Inivisible Error

- If memory accessed is invalid, probably get
  - UNIX:
    - Bus Error
    - Segmentation Fault or Violation
    - A Core Dump: A file called core may appear containning a memory image of the crashed process
  - Or just crash

## String

### Char

- By default, type `char` is a **signed** *1 byte* value
  - -127 to +127
  - But can be unsigned on some implementation (0-255)
- ASCII encoded (7-bit) reprents at most 128 characters
- UTF-8 is widely used to represent more char
  - 1-4 bytes encoding (e.g. Unicode)
  - UTF-8 is a *encoding system* for Unicode

### ASCII

- Capability
  - Control Char (0-31, including tab, newline, *null* etc.)
  - Printable Chars (32-126, letters, digits, symbols and punctuation marks)
  - Delete Char (127)

### String - Char Arrays

- Declaration
  - `char vowels[] = {'a','e','i','o','u'};`
  - `char day[] = "Monday";`
- String literals always end with a null `'\0'` to mark the end
- The array must be large enough to hold *the string chars and a NULL*

### Null

- Simplification for a loop boolean expression
  - `for (int n = 0; s[n]; n ++){}`

### Lines of text

```c
    char lines[][80] = {
    "Some text.",
    "The second line.",
    "The last Line."
    };
```

### *C String* functions

- `#include<string.h>`
  - `strlen()`: length (excluding \0)
  - `strcpy(string1, string2)` copy 2 into 1
  - `strcat(string1, string2)` append a copy of 2 to 1 (enough space required)
  - `strchr(string, chr)` return the idx position of the *first occurrence* of the char, or *null* is not found
  - `strcmp(string1, string2)` compare two strings
    - s1 > s2, return int
    - s1 == s2, return 0
    - s1 < s2, return int less than zero
    - Compared *char by char*, ordering based on char code
  - `strstr(string, substring)` find a substring
    - return true or false (int)

### Inputing *C String*

```c
char name[50];
scanf("%49s", name);
```

- Must specify the max number of chars accepted (including null)
- Otherwise a risk of ***overflow***
  - overwritten other parts of the memory
  - serious security problem
- `scanf(%s)` read one word at a time, stops at the first space (or \t, \n)

### `fgets()`

- Alternative to Scanf
- `fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);`
  - read all chars up to the end of line or the array is full (takes null into account)
  - Don't use another function called `gets`!!, **not safe**

## Functions

- a named statement sequence (A.K. procedure or method)
- Order matters, function cannot be called before declear

### Function Arguments

- `void func(int parameter)`
- parameter is re-created and re-initialised for every call to the function

### Argument vs. Parameter

- Argument
  - `func(argument);`
  - A value passed to the function in the function call
  - A literal, value of var or value of expression
- Parameter
  - A var defined in the function definition, initialised by an argument value
  - `void myFunction(int parameter){}`

### Multi-parameter

- A good practice is no more than *5 or 6* maximum

### Parameter Type

- The number of args supplied in a call must be correst and have *compitable type*
- *compitable type* means the same type or the value can be converted in some way (e.g. int to float)

### Implicit Conversion

- Type promotion
  - short to int
  - int to long
  - no information is lost
- Type conversion
  - *information could be lost*
  - **int to double**, safe *except for edge cases*
  - **float, double to int**, cause compiler warning
    - changes 2.13 to 2
  - **double to float**, no warning but may lose information
  - **pointer to int,** int to pointer
    - Gives a warning and allowed
    - not useful
    - pointer can be think as a **unsigned int**

### Unreacheable code

- gcc won't report warning or error
  - optimisation phases remove the unreached code

### Return

- Mathematical functions: always return the *same value* when applied the *same arg(s)*
  - *Referential Transparency*
- But C functions can be written to ***return different values*** when applied the same args
- C functions can also have *side-effects* (e.g. doing input or output, updating data structures etc.)

### Recursion

- Limits
  - To many calls without returnning will cause the program to crash
    - Uses up all the *available stack memroy*
    - Unpreditable, can result in *other memory being written*
    - Program cannot recover
  - Error message
    - `5328 segmentation fault [./[filename]]`
      - segmentation fault means invalid memory access

### Function Signature

`int f(char c)`

- Every function should have a *unique signature* within a sigle program
  - Compiler checks for the current file it is compiling
  - The **Linker** gives a warning or error when *creating the complete executable program*
- A declaration is a function signature + semicolon
  - `int f(char c);`
- A definition includes the body
  - `int f(char c) {...}`

### Use of Function Declaration

- A fuinction must at least be *declared* before called in a function call expression
- Header files contains only function declarations
  - Allows you to call a function *before it's defined in your src file*
  - or the function is in another src file

### Order of Definition

- to change the order of definition
  - declare before definitions

    ```c
    int a(char ch);
    double b(int x, int y);
    void c();
    // a,b can call each other given that the declaration has been written
    double b(int x, int y){
        ...;
        c();
        ...
    }
    int a(char ch){...}
    void c(){...}
    ````

## Terminal Based I/O

### the File *Abstractions*

- the concept of treating input / output devices (e.g. files in the system) as abstract entitles
- that can be accessed and manipulated through a set of *standard functions*
  - `open`, `read or write`, `close`

### File Handle (or File Pointer)

- connects a file with an actual device (e.g. keyboard) or file in the filing system
  - a program sees a file it can read/write to, *regardless of what the handle is actually connected to*

### Default Files

- `stdin`: connected to the default input (keyboard)
- `stdout`: connected to the default output (terminal view)
- `stderr`: connected to the default error output (terminal view)

- Created automatically when program is run
- Default configuration, but *can be easily overriden*

### Printing

`printf("Hello World")`

- defined in the std C lib
- writes to *stdout*
- format
  - `printf(format_string, values)`
  - `%`denotes a conversion or formatting char
    - `i and d` Integer
    - `u` unsigned integer
    - `o` octal integer
    - `x` Hexa integer using a-f
    - `X` Hexa integer using A-F
    - etc.

### Left justification (data formatting)

- aligns the text or data on the left-hend within a defined width
- `printf("[%20s]" "Hello")`
  - prints `[         Hello]`
- Left justification `printf("[%-20s]","Hello")`
  - prints `[Hello         ]`

### Input

- Inputing char
  - `scanf("%c", &chr);`
- Inputing String
  - `scanf("%s", string)`
  - does not require `&` indentation (`char string[length]` gives a memory address(?))

### Buffer

- Program is paused waiting for user to type input, followed by *\<return\> button*
  - Entire line of user input goes into a buffer
- Program continues and takes input from the buffer
- **Wont' be paused again** until the buffer is empty
  - is capable of read multiple numbers from the input
  - the program *does not read directly from the keyboard*

### Clearing the input

```c
char ch;
while ((ch = getchar()) != '\n' && ch != EOF);
```

- `getchar()`: returns the next char from the stdin input buffer
  - `EOF`(-1): means no more input, since -1 is *not a valid character code*
- `ch != EOF` is evaluated only if the input *is not* a `\n`

### EOF in char

- In binary *unsigned* char, 255 is 11111111
- In binary *signed* char, 255 is -1 (the left most bit is 1, hence negative)

### I/O redirection

- stdin, stdout and stderr can be redirected to different files

```shell
# read from a file
a.out < inputFile
# write to a file
a.out > outputFile
#send through a pipe to the stdin or other file
a.out | more
```

## Scope and Lifetime

### Scope of A Name

- The *scope* of a name determines where in the src it's valid
- Use of a name outside its scope potentially results in an error

### Different Kinds of Variable

- File Scope (External var)
  - Declared *outside* a function
  - valid from the point of declaration
  - *sort of global scope*
- Local Scope (Internal var)
  - within a compound statement (e.g. function bodies)
  - valid from the point of declaration
  - A.K. *block scope*

### Parameter Variables

- A parameter is only accessible while the function is executing
- is a kind of *local variable* with specific init rule

### Scope

- The part of src where a name is valid
- A name can be used only *inside* the scope where it is declared
- Nothing outside can *see the name* or *use it*
  - In some cases, *C compiler gurss the type of an undeclared name*

### Local Variable Lifetime

- Lifetime of *local variable* is determined by *scope* and *when memory is allocated*
- Memory is allocated *when a local scope is entered at runtime*
- Memory is deallocated when the scope is exited
  - Uses a **stack**

*`With C, it is possible to access deallocated memory BY MISTAKE!!, check carefully`*

### File Scope Variable Lifetime

- The **entire runtime of the program**
- Memory is allocated once when the program starts
- Remains until the program ends
- The var can be used only when the name is *in scope*
  - Not being in scope doesn't affect the memory allocation

### Deallocation

- **not destroyed or removed**
- means the memory is free to be reused for other vars or data
- the contents on the deallocated memory **remains the same** until reallocated and overwritten
- The memory of local, parameter variables is allocated automatically
  - Sometime referred to as *auto variables*

### Compound Statement

- A statement that contains *a list of statements*

  ```c
  {
    // statements
  }
  ```

- Defines a *local scope*
- Also referred to as a *block*

### Nested Scope

```c
if(...){
  int n = 1;
  for (...){
    int n = 2; // A new variable local to the nested scope, hiding the outside n
  }
  int n = 3; // Error, n already declared in this scope
}
```

### Reusability of Names

- Can use the same name that declared in *disjoint scopes*

### Global Scope

- The scope of the entire program
  - Cross multiple source files (translation units)
- *C Global Scopes*
  - Functions can be called from any src file
    - Must be declared in files they are not defined in (header `.h` file)
    - File scope vars can be made "Global" using `extern`
      - Can be considered a poor practice

### Localisation

- should try to limit the scope to the smallest region
- Reduce risk of the *misuse* of vars
  - Larger scope -> Higher likelihood of being mistakenly used (conflicts)
  - Larger program, more programmer, more possible mistakes
- **particularly important with Java**

## Pointer

- Pointer holds a memory address
  - The **location** of a var, data structure or a function
  - Pointer variable holds the *address in forms of a value* located in memory
    - The size of a pointer *depends on the machine*
    - Typically 8Bytes
    - Shorter on devices like MicroBit or Arduino

### Memory Address

- A *C program* runs in a n ***Address Space***
  - A continuous seq of memory, uauslly measured in bytes
  - The address space is mapped to physical memory
    - *On Linux, MacOS, Window only the memory used is allocated to physical memory*
- Each memory location has an address
  - *Byte* oriented, starting from 0
  - 64MBytes ($2^{26}$) is 0 to 0x4000000
  - 4GBytes ($2^{32}$) is 0 to 0xFFFFFFFF
- The pointer size in bits must be *big enough* to represent all the memory locations
  - 4GB requires 32bits

### Pointer-based Data Structure

- Linked List
- Trees
- Array etc.

### *C Pointer* Types

- Type name + "*"
  
  ```c
  int *p; // pointer to an int
  char *c; // pointer to a char
  ```

  - Can specified to any type
- Pointer to Pointer
  - `int **p;`;
- Pointer to a function
  - `int (*functionPointer)(int)`
  - a pointer to a function with one int parameter and returns a int, named `functionPointer`

### Address-of operator &

- the operator returns the address of a var

  ```c
  int i = 10;
  int *p = &i; // p points at i
  int **q = &p;
  ```

  - if i goes out of scope, the pointer p *still points at the same place*
  - but this memory will be free to use by another variable
  - *p points to the address, but the element might change*

### De-reference or Indirection Operation

- `int *p = n`: Assign the address of n to p
- `int p = &n`: Same as above
- `int t = *p`: Get the value pointed by p
- `*p = 10`: Assign the value to the location pointed by p

### Pointer and Array

`int myArray[10];`

- myArray is decays to a pointer to the first element in the array
- `int *p = myArray`, no `&` needed
  - or `int *p = &(myArray[0])`

### Decays

- The type of Array can *decay* to a pointer (e.g. int array -> int pointer)
  - Another kind of *implicit conversion*
  - The *identifier* of an Array decays to pointer when
    - **used** in expression
    - passed as **argument**
  - Applies to any pointer type

### Pointer Arithmetic

```c
int *p = myArray;
*p = 20; //myArray[0] = 20;
*(p+1) = 30 //myArray[0+1] = 30;
int n = *(p+5) //get myArray[5]
```

### Size of an Array

```c
int array[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
int size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])
```

- `sizeof()` can determine the size of an array *defined using an array type*
  - The array itself does not store its size, but the type of element does

### Operators for Pointer

- The size has been taken into account by operators
  - e.g. add one to a int* pointer increment it by 4 bytes (sizeof int)
- Valid Operators
  - +, - (int to pointer)
  - \- difference between pointers (subtract one from another)
    - pointer addition is **not allowed!**
    - this is meaningless
    - and might not gives a valid array index
  - ++, --
  - +=, -=
  - comparison operators are allowed
  - multiplication and division are **not allowed**

### String Copy Implementation

  ```c
  void strcpy(char to[], char from[]){
    int i = 0;
    while ((to[i] = from[i]) != '\0')
    i ++;
  }

  // or 

  void strcpy(char *to, char *from){
    while (*from){
      *to++ = *from++; //copy from to 'to', then increment both
      *to = '\0' //add null at the end, will be replaced if not the end
    }
    // or just while(*to++ = *from++);
  }
  ```

- GCC Lib implementation

  ```c
  char* strcpy(char *dest, const char *src){
    return memcpy(dest, src, strlen(src) + 1);
  }
  // operates directly on memory, unsafe!
  // does not check the size or if the pointer is valid
  ```

## Struct

- A way to group related vars
- Allows multiple values to be passed or returned

### Struct Initialisation

- The struct implicitly has a *two-part name*: "struct + [user-defined name]"
- `struct point p1 = {1,2};`

### `typedef`

- `typedef <type> <newname>`
- `typedef int Length;`, give int an alternative name "Length", no type conversion needed
- `typedef struct myStruct {} myStruct;`, re-name `struct myStruct` to `myStruct`

### Pointer to a Struct

- Structsare *typically allocated dynamic memory* and accessed via pointers

## Dynamic Memory

### Address Space in C

![Memory Space](Principle of Programming/2024-04-10-02-32-21.png)

- Stack: used by *parameters and vars* (lifetime is limited to scope)
- Free Space: Dynamically adjusted (shrink when more memory is used), program fails when ran out
- Heap: Dynamically allocated memory accessed by *pointers*
- Globals: Unintialised data, variables decleared outside of functions
- Constants: Initialised data, read only Literal values
- Code: can be read-only, or stored in flash or ROM

### Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Allocate memory for variables, arrays and data structures on *Heap*
- Memory remain allocated until explicitly *freed*, regardless of scope and function calls
- But the programmer has to **MANUALLY manage memory allocation**
  - Allocate when needed
  - Free when no longer used
    - Memory leak if forgets

### Memory Mangement Methods

- **Calloc/Malloc/Free**

```c
char *string = calloc(100, sizof(char)); // contiguous allocation, specifically for array allocation
char *string = malloc(100 * sizeof(char)); // memory allocation, used to allocate a block of memory
// both returns a pointer to the first value
free(string) // release the memory 
```

### Linked List

```c
typedef struct Node{
  char *name;
  int age;
  struct Node *next;
} Node;

// create Node

## Bulding Abstraction

- A header file: declares the functions that other code can use
- A *.c file* that contains the definition of vars and functions for the component

### Header File

```c
//file "turtle.h"

void plotLine(double, double);
void moveTo(int, int);
```

- Declare the functions and wait to be called by another file

### API

- A collection of public functions
  - Application Programming Interface
  - The implementation is stored in `.c` file
    - *an example of encapsulation*
    - A.K. *Information Hiding*

### *C Component* v. Code Lib

- Component
  - Code that implements a chunk of behaviour
  - e.g. A List Data Structure or Database Behaviour
- Code Lib
  - Code that implements a collection of behaviour
  - e.g. `<string.h>` lib, ML algorithms
- Both consist of collection of header and c file
- `.h` define the available *public functions* and *data type*

### Using Component or Lib

- Include the `.h` files
- Compile the code using `gcc -c <files>.c` (this generates a .o file, not executable)
- Link the code with the compiled library or component (`gcc -o program main.o, A.o, B.o`)

## Computer Memory

### Memory

- **RAM** (Random Access Memory)
  - Or DRAM (Dynamic)
  - Volatile (*content lost when not powered*)
  - Store current running code and data (e.g. *systemOS, App*)
  - **fast access** (read/write cycles)

- **ROM** (Read-only Memory)
  - Non-volatile
  - Typically stores code and data needed to **boot a machine**
  - Or *firmware*

- **EEPROM** (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)
  - Non-volatile, but *can be erased and rewritten*
  - Used as updatable firmware

- **Flash Memory**
  - Non-volatile, but can be *re-written many times easily*
  - Used in USB, SD cards, Solid Disk Drive etc.
  - Relatively fast

- **Cache Memory**
  - Very fast and used to *temporarily* store data for *quick access* 
  - Multi-level
    - Processor core caches
    - Shared caches
    - Main memory cache
  - **Expensive & Limited Capacity**
  - But *reduced the need* to access slower main RAM
  - needs reload on context changes (e.g. *thread/processor switch*)
  - Entirely managed by **HARDWARE**, unaccessible

### Memory Hierarchy

- (From Fast to Slow)
  - **Temporary**
    - CPU Registration
    - Level 1 CPU Cache
    - Level 2 Memory Cache
    - RAM (Physical & Virtual)
  - **Permanent**
    - Storage (ROM/EEPROM/HardDrive/Network)
  
### Buses

- Control busses
