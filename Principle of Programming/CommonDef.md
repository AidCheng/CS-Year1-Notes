# Common Definitions in C

- Virtual Memory
  - A C memory management scheme that store the data temporary in a virtual memory with pages and map to physical memory when needed 
- Static
  - a keyword used in C to store the var in statically allocated memory so that the variable will be accessible until the program terminates
- Scope
  - A region of code where a function or variable is accessible
- Lifetime
  - The time period during which a variable can be used
- #define
  - A pre-processor keyword used to indicate that this line is a macro-definition. Used to improve readability
- Segamentation Fault
  - indcates invalid memory access
- Pointer Arithmetic
  - Use of arithmetic operators on the pointer value to obtain the element in a datastructure like array
- #include
  - a way of including external libs or header files
- Imperative Programming
  - The type of programming that follows a series of statements to achieve an outcome
- Overflow
  - Occurs when a computation results in a value is outside the range representable by the data type used
- Expression
  - A set of entities that connects operators, representing a single value
- Declaration
  - A specification of a function, typically includes
- Heap
  - A part of computer memory that is used to hold dynamically allocated memory (through malloc and free)
- Pointer
  - A variable that contains memory address
- Input buffering
  - where the user input is temparorily sotred and read by the program until all the input is read.
- Compound Statement
  - A block of statements inside two curly braces
- Free
  - A function in C that frees a memory address on the heap indicating it no longer needed
- Local Scope
  - A specific area within the code where variable are accissible and valid
- Global Scope
  - The outermost and highest level scope within a program
- File scope
  - Accessible within a specific source code file

# Common Terms in Haskell

- Curried function
  - A function that can take multiple parameters by applying the function to the first parameter and creates a partially applied function
- Do
  - Syntax sugar over Monad typeclass, allow monadic code to be written in an imperative style
- TypeClass
  - A set of behaviours that can be implemented for one or a number of types (e.g. `Ord`, `Num` etc.)
- List Comprehenstion:
  - A method of creating list upon other lists
- Pattern Matching
  - A way of allowing function to operate differently under different input
- Polymorphism
  - represent the property of having multiple types
- Algebraic Data Type
  - A type formed by combining other types
